(Please forgive me the lack of proper terminology, structure etc.)<br>
**This project is heavily WIP and everything is subject to change**

# Design notes:
The language is supposed to reflect the nature of the species.<br>
This means that the sentences should be short and
contain as much information as possible, as Doguns speak slowly. <br>
I am also trying to make the language simple. I try to look at every feature and question why does it exist.

# Phonetics:
## Pronunciation:
For more information on pronunciation [click on this table](https://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/).
### Vowels:
|       | near-front    | back                   |
|:-----:|:-------------:|:----------------------:|
| close | i /I/ ii /I:/ | u /u/                  |
| mid   | e /ɛ/ ee /ɛ:/ | o /o/<br>a /ʌ/ aa /ʌ:/ |

### Consonants
|                         | bilabial    | labio-dental | alveolar    | velar       | glottal |
|:-----------------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:--------|
| plosive                 | p /p/ b /b/ |              | t /t/ d /d/ | k /k/ g /g/ |         |
| nasal                   | m /m/       |              | n /n/       |             |         |
| trill                   |             |              | r /r/       |             |         |
| fricative               |             | f /f/ v /v/  | s /s/       |             | h /ɦ/   |
| lateral<br> approximant |             |              | l /l/       |             |         |

Unused letters: c, j, q, w, y, z<br>
Consonant categories:
- Vowels
- Plosives
- Fricatives
- Others

# Grammar (I think?):
## Nouns:
### Plural:
Done via suffix "e"

## Verbs:
- noun with suffix "ah"
- structure is {tense}-{verb}{pronoun without "d"}
- negation is done by adding "n" before tense

### tenses
| tense              | prefix |
|--------------------|:------:|
| present simple     | en     |
| present continuous | in     |
| past simple        | em     |
| future simple      | ef     |
| imperative         | ---    |
| conditional        | ---    |
TODO: Decide whether to use grammatical aspect to replace extra tenses

## Pronouns:
|                  | singular | plural       |
|------------------|:--------:|:------------:|
| 1st person (me)  | da       | daa/<br>daae |
| 2nd person (you) | de       | dee          |
| 3nd person       | di       | die          |
- 1st person plural:
  - whether the recipient of the speech/text is included
  - Example: friend tells you "We won the lottery!"
    - \+listener = you won too
    - \-listener = you didn't win

possessive pronouns have the prefix "a-" (my = ada)
<br>TODO: Possessive for other words
- either a pre/suf- fix, or something "of" someone

## Prepositions:
## Adverbs:
## Adjectives:
TODO: Possible reserved last letter (like verbs have)
- absolute: nothing
- comparative: postfix -o
- superlative: postfix -i
## Determiners:
## Conjunctions:
## Interjections:

## Word structure
- words in their base form should start and end with plosives, except:
  verbs (end with "h")
  pronouns (end with vowel)
  
  - yes: "Doheared"
  - no:  "Doheareh"
- vowels should alternate with consonants
  - yes: "satod", "Doheared"
  - no:  "stod",  "Doheard"

Basic for of word is noun, other types are determined via suffix.
| word<br>type | suffix |
|:------------:|:------:|
| verb         | ah     |
| adjective    | an     |

# Sentence structure:
Same as english for now

# Vocabulary:
WIP


# Writing system:
## Alphabet:
Each column represents an iteration. First iteration is in the style of already existing letters used for ceremonial purposes, the fourth one is simplified for use in common writing.<br>
