(Please forgive me the lack of proper terminology, structure etc.)<br>
**This project is heavily WIP and everything is subject to change**

# Design notes:
The language is supposed to reflect the nature of the species.<br>
This means that the sentences should be short and
contain as much information as possible, as Doguns speak slowly. <br>
I am also trying to make the language simple. I try to look at every feature and question why does it exist.

# Phonetics:
## Pronunciation:

Consonant categories:

- Others


# Grammar (I think?):
## Word structure
- words in their base form should start and end with plosives  
  - yes: "Doheared"
  - no:  "Doheareh"
- vowels should alternate with consonants
  - yes: "satod", "Doheared"
  - no:  "stod",  "Doheard"

Basic for of word is noun, other types are determined via suffix.
| word<br>type | suffix       |
|:------------:|:------------:|
| verb         | oh           |
| adjective    | <type>n      |

Live:
- noun: dod
- verb (to live): dodoh
- adjective (living): dodan
- possesive (live's + "of live"): adod

Good:
- noun: baak
- adjective
  - absolute: baaken
  - comparative (better): baakon
  - superlative (best): baakun


# Sentence structure:
Same as english for now


## Nouns:
### Plural:
Done via suffix "e"

### Possesive
Done via prefix "a"


## Verbs:
- structure is {tense}-{verb}{pronoun without "d"}
- negation is done by adding "n" before tense

### tenses
| tense              | prefix |
|--------------------|:------:|
| present simple     | --     |
| present continuous | --     |
| past simple        | --     |
| future simple      | --     |
| imperative         | --     |
| conditional        | --     |

TODO: Decide whether to use grammatical aspect to replace extra tenses


## Pronouns:
|                  | singular | plural       |
|------------------|:--------:|:------------:|
| 1st person (me)  | da       | daa/<br>daae |
| 2nd person (you) | de       | dee          |
| 3nd person       | di       | die          |
- 1st person plural:
  - whether the recipient of the speech/text is included
  - Example: friend tells you "We won the lottery!"
    - \+listener = you won too
    - \-listener = you didn't win

possessive pronouns have the prefix "a-" (my = ada)
<br>TODO: Possessive for other words
- either a pre/suf- fix, or something "of" someone


## Adjectives:
There are three types of adjectives:

| name        | suffix | description |
|:-----------:|:------:|:------------|
| absolute    | -en    | Describe a property of something |
| comparative | -on    | Describe a relation of something (to something) |
| superlative | -un    | Describe a property of something on the highest degree |

# Vocabulary:

# Writing system:
## Alphabet:
Each column represents an iteration. First iteration is in the style of already existing letters used for ceremonial purposes, the fourth one is simplified for use in common writing.<br>
