(Please forgive me the lack of proper terminology)<br>
**This project is heavily WIP and everything is subject to change**

# Design notes:
The language is supposed to reflect the nature of the species.<br>
This means that the sentences should be short and
contain as much information as possible, as Doguns speak slowly. <br>
I am also trying to make the language simple. I try to look at every feature and question why does it exist.

# Pronunciation:
TODO: Use phonetic alphabet

| letter | pronunciation  | letter | pronunciation   |
|--------|----------------|--------|-----------------|
| a      | a in "ah"      | b      | b in "bat"      |
| c      | same as "k"    | d      | d in "Dogun"    |
| e      | e in "epic"    | f      | f in "fine"     |
| g      | g in "give"    | h      | h in "heraldic" |
| i      | i in "bit"     | j      | unused          |
| k      | k in "like"    | l      | l in "like"     |
| m      | m in "moo"     | n      | n in "no"       |
| o      | o in "nothing" | p      | p in "pick"     |
| q      | unused         | r      | r in "request"  |
| s      | s in "sick"    | t      | t in "tree"     |
| u      | u in "put"     | v      | v in "verb"     |
| w      | unused         | x      | unused          |
| y      | unused         | z      | unused          |


# Nouns:
Plural:

|              |  plural    | plural<br>collective |
|--------------|------------|----------------------|
| **postfix**  | -a         | -e                   |
| **examples** | ---------- | -------------------- |
| earth        | earha      | earhe                |
- plural collective = e.g. races, species
  - Dogun as species, not as a group (like a village)
TODO: is "Dohearh" a species or a member of the species?

# Verbs:
- end with "h"
- structure is {tense}-{verb}{pronoun without "d"}
  - (e.g. "I write" =  en- + wroth + a = en-wrotha) ("en" signalises present simple)
- negation is done by adding "n" before pronoun
  - (e.g. "I don't write" = "n" + en- + vroth + a = nen-vrotha)

### tenses
- postfix

| tense              | prefix |
|--------------------|--------|
| present simple     | -en    |
| present continuous | -in    |
| past simple        | -em    |
| future simple      | -ef    |
| imperative         | ---    |
| conditional        | ---    |


TODO: Decide whether to use grammatical aspect to repalce extra tenses
# Pronouns:
|                  | singular | plural      | plural<br>collective|
|------------------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1st person (me)  | da       | daa/<br>dae | dai                 |
| 2nd person (you) | de       | dea         | dei                 |
| 3nd person       | du       | doa         | doi                 |
- 1st person plural:
  - whether the recipient of the speech/text is included
  - Example: friend tells you "We won the lottery!"
    - \+ = you won too
    - \- = you didn't win

possessive pronouns have the prefix "-a" (our (+ listener) = "adaa")
