(Please forgive me the lack of proper terminology, structure etc.)<br>
**This project is heavily WIP and everything is subject to change**

# Design notes:
The language is supposed to reflect the nature of the species.<br>
This means that the sentences should be short and
contain as much information as possible, as Doguns speak slowly. <br>
I am also trying to make the language simple. I try to look at every feature and question why does it exist.

# Alphabet

TODO: Use phonetic alphabet

# Nouns:
Plural:

|              |  plural    | plural<br>collective |
|--------------|------------|----------------------|
| **postfix**  | -a         | -e                   |
| **examples** | ---------- | -------------------- |
| earth        | earha      | earhe                |
- plural collective = e.g. races, species
  - Dogun as species, not as a group (like a village)
TODO: is "Dohearh" a species or a member of the species?

# Verbs:
- end with "h"
- structure is {tense}-{verb}{pronoun without "d"}
  - (e.g. "I write" =  en- + wroth + a = en-wrotha) ("en" signalises present simple)
- negation is done by adding "n" before pronoun
  - (e.g. "I don't write" = "n" + en- + vroth + a = nen-vrotha)

### tenses
- postfix

| tense              | prefix |
|--------------------|--------|
| present simple     | -en    |
| present continuous | -in    |
| past simple        | -em    |
| future simple      | -ef    |
| imperative         | ---    |
| conditional        | ---    |


TODO: Decide whether to use grammatical aspect to repalce extra tenses
# Pronouns:
|                  | singular | plural      | plural<br>collective|
|------------------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1st person (me)  | da       | daa/<br>dae | dai                 |
| 2nd person (you) | de       | dea         | dei                 |
| 3nd person       | du       | doa         | doi                 |
- 1st person plural:
  - whether the recipient of the speech/text is included
  - Example: friend tells you "We won the lottery!"
    - \+ = you won too
    - \- = you didn't win

possessive pronouns have the prefix "-a" (my = ada)
<br>TODO: Possessive for other words
- either a pre/suf- fix, or something "of" someone

# Prepositions:
# Adverbs:
# Adjectives:
TODO: Possible reserved last leeter (like verbs have)
- absolute: nothing
- comparative: postfix -o
- superlative: postfix -i
# Determiners:
# Conjunctions:
# Interjections:

# Word sructure
One possibility:
- words should start with one of these letters: t, d, k, g, p, b
# Sentence structure:
Same as english for now
