(Please forgive me the lack of proper terminology)<br>
**This project is heavily WIP and everything is subject to change**

# Design notes:
The language is supposed to reflect the nature of the species.<br>
This means that the sentences should be short and
contain as much information as possible, as Doguns speak slowly. <br>
I am also trying to make the language simple. I try to look at every feature and question why does it exist.
