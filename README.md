(Please forgive me the lack of proper terminology, structure etc.)<br>
This project is heavily WIP and everything is subject to change<br>
**For the time being, this project is abandoned. Feel free to continue on it.**

# Design notes:
The language is supposed to reflect the nature of the species.<br>
This means that the sentences should be short and
contain as much information as possible, as Doguns speak slowly. <br>
I am also trying to make the language simple. I try to look at every feature and question why does it exist.

# Grammar (I think?):
## Word structure
Basic for of word is noun, other types are determined via suffix.
| word<br>type | suffix   |
|:------------:|:--------:|
| verb         | oh       |
| adjective    | \<type>n |

Live:
- noun: dod
- verb (to live): dodoh
- adjective (living): dodan
- possesive (live's / "of live"): adod

Good:
- noun: baak
- adjective
  - absolute: baaken
  - comparative (better): baakon
  - superlative (best): baakun


# Sentence structure:
Same as english for now


## Nouns:
Nouns in their base form should start and end with plosives  
  - yes: "Dodeared"
  - no:  "Dodeareh"
- vowels should alternate with consonants
  - yes: "satod", "Doheared"
  - no:  "stod",  "Doheard"

### Plural:
Done via suffix "e"

### Possesive
Done via prefix "a"


## Verbs:
- structure is {tense}-{verb}{pronoun without "d"}
- negation is done by adding "n" before tense

### tenses
